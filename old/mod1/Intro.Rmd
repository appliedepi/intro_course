***Fix image*** TODO

Lectures, Live coding demos, Guided exercises, evaluate
![](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/presentation/images/EDGE.png?raw=true)  



???
- The learning process can be summarised into this acronym "EDGE". Today's session is primarily a *demonstration* with question & answer session. We assume that you have read at least some of the relevant pages in the Epi R Handbook prior to this session. We also offer trainings in which we guide you through case studies with hands-on coaching. 


---
# Course overview

**Audience:** Epidemiologists, public health practitioners, clinicians, applied researchers.  

**Objectives:** Participants learn how to use R, using standard datasets for applied epidemiology in the context of an outbreak investigation case study.

**Prerequisites:**
- Familiarity with epidemiological concepts.  
- Participants with no prior coding experience (e.g. SAS, Stata) are advised to take 1 extra day for the course.  
- Create account at [Applied Epi Community](www.community.appliedepi.org) (online Q&A support forum)

**Take-aways** 
- Comfort using R to import, clean, and perform basic analyses, transformations, and visualizations, and reporting on epidemiological data
- Ability to self-learn and expand your R knowledge  
- Certificate of participation

---
# Course format

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appliedepi/presentations/main/images/CourseTimeline.png)  
35.5 hours synchronous instruction

- *Comprehensive instruction:* 4 days (28 hours)

- *Sustained support:* 7.5 hours of follow-up sessions to help apply the skills to your work context (5 x 1.5-hour group “office hours” sessions)

Note: Applied Epi offers subscription "R Help Desk" services if you want continued on-call support in the months/years ahead.

# Why R? 
### An appetizer for motivation

# Flexibility 

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/presentation/images/interoperability.png?raw=true)  


???
- R can read and write to loads of different software/databases.  
- Can also produce many different outputs  
- Save you time and headache (automated and reproducible workflows)

# Popularity

```
]



???
- R is free - and yet can do more than what expensive licensed software can  
- Most students in the US will have learnt SAS (but changing)  
- Previously limited to academic statisticians - R was not "trusted"  
- But now even pharma companies (e.g. GSK) and regulators are making the switch  
- It is the most widely used statistical programming language.

# Setting the scene  
#### Download our [example R project](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/tree/master/case_study)! (be sure to un-zip)


We created a dedicated R project, a directory containing:  

R project file (`case_study.Rproj`)  
  * `data/` folder  
    * `covid_example_data/` folder 
        * `covid_example_data.xlsx`  
        * `linelist_cleaned.rds`  
        * `covid_shapefile/` folder  
          - `FultonCountryZipCode.shp`...
    * `map_tiles/` folder 
        * base map images for Fulton County...
  * `weekly_report.Rmd` (R markdown script)  
    * `template_style.docx`
    * `weekly_report.docx`
    * `weekly_report.md`
    * `weekly_report_files/` folder

# Rmarkdown parameterisation  

- Rmd files use YAML header

- Use parameters to generalise reports for different scenarios
 + different dates
 + different counties
 
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
params:
  as_of_date: 2021-08-01
  county: "Fulton"
```

- Access parameters with `params$...`

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# filter linelist for county of choice
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  filter(county == params$county)
```

# File paths

#### Use the `{here}` package to find files

.pull-left[
- *Relative* rather than *absolute* file-paths 
  - Better than `setwd()` for sharing
- Finds root directory automatically 
- Open `.Rproj` file first
- package::function() to avoid conflicts
  - `here::here()`
