# This session: objectives & schedule  

**In this module we aim to help you:**  
* Learn an easy way to organize files in an RStudio project  
* How to import data easily with {rio} and {here}  
* Importing and reviewing data in R  
* Principles of tidy data and tips for proper data format

# File management  

R is not just about coding - you must know how to organize your files too.  

In the past, R users were often frustrated by not being able to import their data into R.  

--

In the last 3-5 years, several advancements have made this process easier:  

* **The {rio} package** for importing data  
* **"RStudio projects"** for holding files  
* **The {here} package** for file paths   

Knowing the details of how they work is not so important.  
But know that using these three tools together prevents a lot of headache.

# Importing data with {rio}  

Importing data into R **used to be** painful  

You had to remember one function for each type of file: `read.csv()`, `read_excel()`, `read_xlsx()`...  

--

The {rio} package makes it easy with only one function: **`import()`**  

```{eval=F}
import("surveillance_linelist_20141201.csv")
```

.pull-left[
"rio" is shorthand for  
"R inputs/outputs"  
]

.pull-right[

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "functions_packages", "rio.png")))
```
]



---
# File paths  

.pull-left[

File paths tell R where to look for a file.  

]

.pull-right[

* `r emo::ji("folder")` C:Users  
  * `r emo::ji("folder")` Laura  
      * `r emo::ji("folder")` Documents  
          * `r emo::ji("folder")` intro_course  
               * `r emo::ji("document")` **linelist.csv**
               * `r emo::ji("document")` **analysis.R**


]

This path says to start at C: and go to the folders "Users", "Laura", "Documents"...  

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
import("C:\Users\Laura\Documents\intro_course\data\clean\linelist.csv")
```

--
But will this "absolute" file path work on *your* computer? Mostly likely not, because you do not have a "Laura" folder.  

--

"RStudio projects" allow analyses to be portable between computers.

# RStudio projects  



.pull-left[

An RStudio project is a self-contained and portable R working environment.  

It is a folder with all the files associated with a distinct project:  
* Data files  
* R scripts  
* Outputs  
* etc.

This makes your life immensely easier.  

The project is represented by a .Rproj file in the folder.  

]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "functions_packages", "project_briefcase.png")))
```

]

???
We will help 
You can zip the folder and share it with a colleague, it can be hosted on a shared drive, and can be synced with a Github repository.

# RStudio projects  

.pull-left[

Using R projects, the file path *before* the R project folder is flexible.  

]

.pull-right[

* `r emo::ji("folder")` intro_course (R project folder)  
     * intro_course.Rproj  
     * `r emo::ji("document")` **linelist.csv**
     * `r emo::ji("document")` **my_analysis.R**
]

--

The command **`import("linelist.csv")`** used in an R project...  

...produces this file path on Laura's computer:  

`"C:\Users\Laura\Documents\`**intro_course\linelist.csv"**  

--

...and produces *this* on Rajiv's Mac computer:  

`"home/Rajiv/docs/`**intro_course/linelist.csv"**  






---
# {here}  

.pull-left[

If your script and data are in different subfolders, it can cause problems.  

E.g. if you move your script, the file path to the data can break.  


]

.pull-right[

* `r emo::ji("folder")` intro_course (R project folder)  
     * intro_course.Rproj  
     * .here  
     * `r emo::ji("folder")` scripts
          * `r emo::ji("document")` **my_analysis.R**
     * `r emo::ji("folder")` data  
          * `r emo::ji("folder")` clean  
               * `r emo::ji("document")` **linelist.csv**


]

--

Using {here}, file paths always start from the project **root (top) folder** ("relative").  
**Run from any** location within the R project, this path will find the linelist.csv  

**`here("data", "clean", "linelist.csv")`**  




  


---
# Projects, {here}, & {rio} together  

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
import(here("data", "clean", "linelist.csv"))
```

.pull-left[

Finally, by combining `import()` and `here()` in an RStudio project, we create a command that is truly versatile.  

]


.pull-right[

* `r emo::ji("folder")` intro_course (R project folder)  
     * intro_course.Rproj  
     * .here  
     * `r emo::ji("folder")` scripts
          * `r emo::ji("document")` **my_analysis.R**
     * `r emo::ji("folder")` data  
          * `r emo::ji("folder")` clean  
               * `r emo::ji("document")` **linelist.csv**
