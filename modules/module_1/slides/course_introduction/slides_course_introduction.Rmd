- R is free - and yet can do more than what expensive licensed software can  
- Previously limited to academic statisticians - R was not "trusted"  
- But now even pharma companies (e.g. GSK) and regulators are making the switch  
- It is the most widely used statistical programming language.

# Today: objectives & schedule  

**In this module we aim to help you:**  
* Understand R within the ecosystem of analytical tools  
* Navigate RStudio and R projects  
* Write a basic R script to load packages, import data, and view a dataset

# Data used in this course  

* Ebola case study  
     * Surveillance linelist  
     * Hospital linelists from 5 hospitals  
     * Aggregated case counts from one hospital  
     * Case investigation dataset  
     * Lab dataset  

* Near the end of the course, you will apply your skills to a COVID dataset

# Breakouts and support  

- **General pattern:** Brief explanation -> Live demonstration -> breakout exercises -> plenary debrief  

--

- **Assistant instructors** will facilitate breakout groups and lead plenary debriefs  

--

- **Screen fatigue is real** - you are welcome to turn off your video, but please try to keep video on in breakout discussions  

--

- **Post questions in the Meet Q&A tool** - an instructor will be monitoring and will answer in the chat or verbally  

--

- **Extra support** is available during lunch, in a breakout room, for participants who are very confused  





---
# Agreement with each other 

**Our team will:**  

--

- Create an affirming, supportive learning space

--

- Provide personalized attention, as much as possible  

--

- Allow you space to explore and "tinker" as you learn

--

- Appreciate your expertise

--

**We hope that you will:**  

--

- Reach outside of your comfort zone *(you might discover a new passion!)*  

--

- Try to attend all the sessions, and catch-up if you miss  

--

- Keep trying  

--

- Tell us if you do not understand  

--

- Be supportive of fellow participants

We are in this course to succeed, together
