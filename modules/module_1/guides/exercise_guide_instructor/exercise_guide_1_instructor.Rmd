# Notes  

This module gets the students setup in RStudio with a project, demo script, and interacting with the learnr exercises.  

At the beginning, you will demonstrate how to open a learnr exercise. Then, you can let the students work through the exercise and assist them as-needed.  

# Preparation  

1. Clear your desktop of clutter.  
2. Turn off pop-up notifications from desktop versions of WhatsApp, Signal, Teams, etc.  
3. Open RStudio and adjust the upper-right R project drop-down menu to close any open projects. This way, when you open RStudio it opens as "Project: None".  
4. Open a file explorer window, showing the location where you will save the R project, and have it ready to show.  
5. Open this file (or better: print it and have on your desk)

# Setup  

1. **In Google Meets**:  
     * If you have two displays: share your second display, which contains RStudio and the file explorer. The first display will be contain the Meet.  
     * If you only have one display, show your entire screen and ask an assistant instructor for help with any questions/hands that you cannot see. (TODO maybe there is a way to avoid mirroring in Meets?)

# Exercise setup  

Explain that the course utilizes the R package {learnr} to provide interactive exercises *within* your RStudio window.  

**Share your screen and have the students follow-along step-by-step with you**  

**They can access these same instructions at: https://appliedepi.github.io/intro_course/  **


1) Run this commands in your R console to install the {remotes} package  
`install.packages("remotes")`  

3) Run this command in your R console to install our R package from Github, that contains the exercises:  

  * `remotes::install_github("appliedepi/introexercises", dep = TRUE, force = TRUE)`  
  * If you see a warning about needing RTools, do not worry. This is simply a warning message, but the install should proceed without error.  
  * If prompted to update some R packages, select "All" to update all of the packages.  
  * If you continue to be prompted for package updates, you can select "None" and continue without further updates.  



# To open an exercise  

Show your screen to the students Have the students Watch the gif below - you do not need to follow the steps shown right now, but it introduces you to the exercise environment.  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/README_images/exercise_demo.gif")
```

1) Click on the "Tutorial" tab in the upper-right RStudio pane (which also contains a tab holding your R Environment).  
  * The first time, you may need to restart RStudio for the tutorials to appear.  
  
2) Select the exercise for your current course module (see list in section below) - look for the name "Applied Epi -". For Module 1, the exercise is called "Applied Epi - R setup, syntax, data import".  

  * The exercise will load. Once you see the Applied Epi logo appear, you can begin the exercise.  
  * You can proceed with the exercise in this RStudio pane, or click the small icon in the upper-left to expand this tutorial into a separate window.  
  * Return to the exercise to answer quiz questions and proceed to the next section of the exercise.  
  



# Finish
Close RStudio.    
Return to begin the plenary debrief with the entire class.
