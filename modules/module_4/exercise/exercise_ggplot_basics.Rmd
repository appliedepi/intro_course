## Introduction to R for Applied Epidemiology and Public Health


### Welcome

Welcome to the live course "Introduction to R for applied epidemiologists", offered by [Applied Epi](www.appliedepi.org) - a nonprofit organisation that offers open-source tools, training, and support to frontline public health practitioners.  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/logo.png")
```

### Data visualization  

This exercise focuses on **the fundamentals of using {ggplot2} for data visualization**.

### Format

This exercise will guide you through a set of tasks.  
*You should perform these tasks in RStudio and on your local computer*.  

#### Getting Help  

There are several ways to get help:  

1) Look for the "helpers" (see below)
2) Ask your live course instructor/facilitator for help  
3) Ask a colleague or other participant in the course for tips  
4) Post a question in [Applied Epi Community](www.community.appliedepi.org) in the category for questions about Applied Epi Training  

Here is what those "helpers" will look like:

#### Quiz questions  

Please complete the quiz questions that you encounter throughout the tutorial. **Answering will help you** to comprehend the material, and will also help us to improve the exercises for future students.  

To practice, please answer the following questions:  


```{r quiz-use-helper, echo=F}
quiz(
  question_radio("When should I view the red 'helper' code?",
    answer("After trying to write the code myself", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Before I try coding", correct = FALSE),
    correct = "Reviewing best-practice code after trying to write yourself can help you improve",
    incorrect = "Please attempt the exercise yourself, or use the hint, before viewing the answer."
  )
)
```


```{r quiz-anxious, echo = FALSE}
question_numeric(
 "How anxious are you about beginning this tutorial - on a scale from 1 (least anxious) to 10 (most anxious)?",
 answer(10, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(9, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(8, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(7, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(6, message = "Ok, we will get there together", correct = T),
 answer(5, message = "Ok, we will get there together", correct = T),
 answer(4, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 answer(3, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 answer(2, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 answer(1, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 allow_retry = TRUE,
 correct = "Thanks for sharing. ",
 min = 1,
 max = 10,
 step = 1
)
```



#### Icons  

You will see these icons throughout the exercises:

Icon  |Meaning
------|--------------------
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("eye", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "darkblue")`|Observe  
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("exclamation", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "red")`|Alert!  
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("pen", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "brown")`|An informative note  
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("terminal", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "black")`|Time for you to code!  
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("window-restore", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "darkgrey")`|Change to another window  
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("bookmark", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "orange")`|Remember this for later  










## Learning objectives

In this exercise you will:  

* Learn the "grammar of graphics" syntax used by {ggplot2}  
* Make simple histograms, box plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and line plotss  
* Adjust the color, fill, and shape by adjusting plot aesthetic parameters  
* Save ggplots as PNG files  









## Prepare  

### Prepare your script  

Open the R project, as usual, and your script "ebola_analysis.R". Create a new section below the other code for "simple plots".  

### Load packages  

Run the code to install your R packages. The {ggplot2} package does not need to be listed explicitly, because it is included in the {tidyverse} mega-package (which should already be in your list of packages).  

### Import data  

A the top of the "simple plots" section of code, write a command to import the clean dataset ("surveillance_linelist_clean.rds") and define it as `surv`.  

You should already have this code, from a previous module, that you can copy and paste.  












## Build a plot

Do you know much information about each district, such as the age distribution, or the number of cases? Let's build some plots that tell us more.  


### Open the plot  

Any `ggplot()` command begins with the function `ggplot()`. Within this function, the first argument is `data = `. Provide the name of the dataset to this argument.  

**Run the command below**  

```{r, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv)
```

This has "opened" the plotting canvas for us to build further plot elements.  




### Map columns to "aesthetics"  

Now that we have a canvas, we need to tell R what we want on the X-axis and on the Y-axis. The columns that we will **map** to the axes are simple examples of the plot's "aesthetics". Note this word "**aes**thetics" - the root **aes** becomes part of the next R command.  

The second argument of `ggplot()` is `mapping = `, and this is where you **map columns in the data to components of the plot that may vary for each row of data**.  

For example, if we "map" the Y-axis to the column `age_years`, then every row in the data will be evaluated and may be placed on a different height on the Y-axis.  

**`aes()`**  

The `mapping = ` function is atypical in that you must provide the values to it **within the `aes()` function.**  

`mapping = aes(x = COLUMN, y = COLUMN)`  

Remember that this code above is occurring *within* the `ggplot()` function.  

Try to write a `ggplot()` command where you map the X-axis to the column `district`, and Y-axis to the column `age_years`.

ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, y = age_years))
```

</br>
</details>

```{r quiz-aes-district}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - aesthetics",
  question("How many breaks are there in the X-axis?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("12"),
    answer("9"),
    answer("10", correct = T),
    answer("4")
  ),
  question("What is the default Y-axis label interval?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("5"),
    answer("20", correct = T),
    answer("30"),
    answer("10")
  )
)
```




### Add geom layers  

Now that we have our canvas, and we have designated our axes... we can begin to visualize the data!  

This is done by adding `geom_()` commands, which each create a different kind of visualization.  

We have completed one full component of the `ggplot()` command - the parentheses are closed, and the command can run without error. So how do we add additional components to the plot? 

**Add the +**  

The plus symbol connects the different lines of the `ggplot()` command. In some ways, it is like the pipe operator, but links commands *within* the ggplot.  

**Add the plus, and on the new line write `geom_point()`, run the command**  

<!--

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, y = age_years))+
  geom_point()
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->

You can choose to indent the new command, so indicate to a reader that it is a sub-component of the `ggplot()`, but the command will run either way.  

The `geom_point()` has visualized all of the data as points.  


```{r quiz-geom-points}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - points",
  question("How many cases were reported in Central I district?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("25"),
    answer("35"),
    answer("Not possible to know", correct = T),
    answer("21")
  )
)
```

With a discrete variable on the X-axis and a continuous distribution on the Y-axis, it is difficult to know exactly how many cases there are! Each point may represent one case, but it could also represent 5 with same exact age value, with overlapping points.  

Let's try another geom to solve this problem. **Replace `geom_point()` with `geom_jitter()` and re-run the command.**  


<!--
NOTE: Below is the solution (all within details tags collapsed)
-->

<details>
<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, y = age_years))+
     geom_jitter()
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->


**Go to the Help pane of RStudio (by the Plots pane) and search for "geom_jitter" in the search bar in the upper-right**.  

**Read the "Description"** to understand exactly what the function is doing to avoid overlapping points.  

**Review the "Aesthetics"** list near the bottom. These are other plot aesthetics that you can adjust to vary the appearance of this geom layer.  

Within the `geom_jitter()` function, enter a few of these aesthetics and try adjusting them as follows:  

* `color = "blue"`  
* `size = 5`  
* `shape = 4`  


```{r quiz-geom-aes}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - aesthetics",
  question("What do you think the plot aesthetic `alpha` adjusts?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("Alphabetical ordering"),
    answer("Axis color"),
    answer("Transparency", correct = T),
    answer("Size")
  ),
  question("What shape is produced by setting `shape = 3` within geom_jitter()?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("Alphabetical ordering"),
    answer("Axis color"),
    answer("Transparency", correct = T),
    answer("Size")
  )
)
```


### Add more geoms  

The jitter plot is nice, but let's add some statistical display to it. **Add `geom_boxplot()` below the `geom_jitter()` command**.  


<!--

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("lightbulb", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "darkgold")` Click to read a hint</summary>
</br>

Don't forget to add a + at the end of `geom_jitter()`
</br>
</details>

<!--
NOTE: Below is the solution (all within details tags collapsed)

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, y = age_years))+
     geom_jitter()+
     geom_boxplot()
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->


We can now see where summary statistical values lie for each district, such as the median and inter-quartile ranges. But the points are now hidden by the boxplots. **Add and adjust the `alpha = ` aesthetic for the boxplots only. What value allows you to see the plots?  

<!--

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("lightbulb", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "darkgold")` Click to read a hint</summary>
</br>

Try several values between 0 and 1.  

</br>
</details>

</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, y = age_years))+
     geom_jitter()+
     geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7)
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->


### Violin plots  

As alternative, replace the `geom_boxplot()` with `geom_violin()`, and use the same `alpha = ` level as before to have some transparency.  

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, y = age_years))+
     geom_jitter()+
     geom_violin(alpha = 0.7)
```

There is not much difference in the case ages between each district... let's try a violin plot on another topic. Try this code:  

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = gender, y = ht_cm))+
     geom_violin(alpha = 0.7, size = 2)
```

```{r quiz-geom-violin}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - violin plot",
  question("What is aes(x = gender, y = ht_cm) doing in this command?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("Sets gender as the Y axis, and height as the X axis", message = "Almost... but check again - which axes?"),
    answer("Sets the Automated Esoteric Settings (AES)", message = "No, this does not exist."),
    answer("Sets gender as the X axis, and height as the Y axis", correct = T)
  ),
  question("What did the 'size = ' aesthetic adjust for these violin plots?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("Size of the violin"),
    answer("Size of the border line", correct = T),
    answer("Size of the plot"),
    answer("Size of the plot labels")
  )
)
```


What does the violin plot communicate that the boxplot does not?  

What does the box plot communicate that the violin plot does not?  

What do the points show that either the box or violin plot do not?  

**What do you think is the best combination of these three geoms (points, boxplots, violins)?**  


## Dynamic aesthetics  

Until now, you have been editing aesthetics like `color`, `alpha`, `size`, and `shape` by assigning them to **static values** such as 3, "blue", or 0.2.  

**Now, we will assign them to columns, and the display for each point in the data will vary**  

### 

Let's re-build our old boxplot, **with the aesthetic `color` statically-assigned to "blue", and `alpha` statically-assigned to 0.5**:  

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, y = age_years))+
     geom_jitter()+
     geom_boxplot(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5)
```

Let's change the command so that `fill` is assigned to the column `district`.  

```{r quiz-aes-dynamic}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - Dynamic aesthetic assignments",
  question("What happens if you run the command above, but replace 'blue' with the column name: district?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("The boxplots re-arrange by district"),
    answer("The boxes become the geographical shape of the district"),
    answer("The boxes fill (color) become different for each district", message = "No... this is what we wanted, but it should not have happened."),
    answer("There is an R error saying 'object district not found'", correct = T)
  ),
  question("What needs to change in order to make each boxplot a different fill?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("Try another column name"),
    answer("Move this part of the command ('fill = district') inside the aes()", correct = T),
    answer("Try the command five more times, as written"),
    answer("Restart R and try again")
  )
)
```

You have discovered that if you **map** an aesthetic to a column name, it must be located *within* the **`mapping = aes()`** for the change to be applied.  

Remember how we assigned columns to the X-axis and the Y-axis? Those assignments were dynamic as well, and they are located within the `mapping = aes()`.  

**Note the legend that has automatically appeared on the right side of the plot**. How have missing values been treated in this plot? How are they marked? Which color was automatically assigned to them? Where in the order do they appear, along the X-axis and in the legend?

     geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5)
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->


**How would you change the color of the points?**  

Be aware of this nuance: For shapes that have *area*, such as boxplots, histograms, etc, the *inside* color is changed with the `fill` aesthetic. However, points (including `geom_jitter()`) are changed with the aesthetic `color`.  

**Change the color of the points to also vary by district, and set the boxplot's `alpha = 0`**.

```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->

**Remove the `color = district` from the aes()** - return the points to their original black.  




### Labels  

Let's add a few quick labels to make our plot more clear.  


**Add `labs()` to the bottom of the command** (using a + symbol), and provide the following arguments:  

* `title = "My title`  
* `subtitle = "Subtitle here"` 
* `x = "District"`  
* `y = "Age (years)"`  
* `caption = "Among an Ebola outbreak, 2014"`  
* `fill = "District"`

    answer("Lower-right", correct = T),
    answer("Top-right'")
  ),
  question("Why did we use the fill argument to adjust the legend title?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("Because fill always adjusts the legend", message = "No, try again. You would actually adjust the legend using a different parameter, if it had been created another way."),
    answer("Because the legend was created when we mapped fill to a column", correct = T),
    answer("Because the world 'fill' means 'legend' in old English", message = "No, this is not true.")
  )
)
```


## Bar plots  


Now that you have explored points, jittered points, boxplots, and violins, let's try some other **geoms**:  

  

A bar plot could be used to show the number of cases reported in each district.  

**Try a command using the geom `geom_bar()`. Note that you should only supply an `x = ` aesthetic - there is no need for `y = ` as the number of rows in the dataset will be counted individually.  


<!--

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("lightbulb", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "darkgold")` Click to read a hint</summary>
</br>

In this new ggplot command, remove the `geom_jitter()` and `geom_boxplot()` commands. Replace them with one `geom_bar()` command.  

</br>
</details>

<!--

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district))+
     geom_bar()
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->

The rows in the data have now been displayed as a bar plot!  

Can you change the bars to all be the color "lightblue" using the `fill` argument?  





### Set the fill aesthetic dynamically  

The previous plot examined age as a continuous variable (on the Y-axis).  

**How would we show the age distribution using the bar plot?**  

**Change the plot so that the `fill` aesthetic is assigned dynamically, to a *categorical* column in the dataset**.

Assign `fill` to the column `age_cat`.

Now we can see the age categories in the legend, and bars are "stacked".  


### Order of stacked bars  

**What if you want to reverse the order of the bars? Perhaps you want the youngest age category on the bottom: we'll give you this code:  

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, fill = fct_rev(age_cat)))+
  geom_bar()
```

In the above code we've used the `fct_rev()` function, which comes from the {forcats} package. We'll explain more later, but this package contains functions that create explicit ordering of values. By wrapping the `fct_rev()` around the column `age_cat`, ggplot reverses the default ordering of that variable.  

If the colors look ugly to you, don't worry. We'll learn later how to adjust the colors.  

### Adjacent bars  

`geom_bar()` accepts the argument `position = `, which can be assigned to the value "dodge". Try to add this argument to `geom_bar()` and see what happens (don't forget the quotation marks).

## Scatter plots  

Use 

 



## Histogram  

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(x = age_years))+
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(x = ht_cm))+
  geom_histogram()
```



## Line plots  





## Facets


```{r}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(x = date_onset))+
  geom_histogram()+
facet_wrap(~district)
```



Which district has the earliest cases?  

gghighlight

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(x = date_onset, fill = district))+
  geom_histogram()+
facet_wrap(~district)+
gghighlight::gghighlight()
```
