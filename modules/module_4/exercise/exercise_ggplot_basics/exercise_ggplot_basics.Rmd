## Introduction to R for Applied Epidemiology and Public Health


### Welcome

Welcome to the live course "Introduction to R for applied epidemiologists", offered by [Applied Epi](www.appliedepi.org) - a nonprofit organisation that offers open-source tools, training, and support to frontline public health practitioners.  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/logo.png")
```

### Data visualization  

This exercise focuses on **the fundamentals of using {ggplot2} for data visualization**.

### Format

This exercise will guide you through a set of tasks.  
*You should perform these tasks in RStudio and on your local computer*.  

#### Getting Help  

There are several ways to get help:  

1) Look for the "helpers" (see below)
2) Ask your live course instructor/facilitator for help  
3) Ask a colleague or other participant in the course for tips  
4) Post a question in [Applied Epi Community](www.community.appliedepi.org) in the category for questions about Applied Epi Training  

Here is what those "helpers" will look like:

#### Quiz questions  

Please complete the quiz questions that you encounter throughout the tutorial. **Answering will help you** to comprehend the material, and will also help us to improve the exercises for future students.  

To practice, please answer the following questions:  


```{r quiz-use-helper, echo=F}
quiz(
  question_radio("When should I view the red 'helper' code?",
    answer("After trying to write the code myself", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Before I try coding", correct = FALSE),
    correct = "Reviewing best-practice code after trying to write yourself can help you improve",
    incorrect = "Please attempt the exercise yourself, or use the hint, before viewing the answer."
  )
)
```


```{r quiz-anxious, echo = FALSE}
question_numeric(
 "How anxious are you about beginning this tutorial - on a scale from 1 (least anxious) to 10 (most anxious)?",
 answer(10, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(9, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(8, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(7, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(6, message = "Ok, we will get there together", correct = T),
 answer(5, message = "Ok, we will get there together", correct = T),
 answer(4, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 answer(3, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 answer(2, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 answer(1, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 allow_retry = TRUE,
 correct = "Thanks for sharing. ",
 min = 1,
 max = 10,
 step = 1
)
```



#### Icons  

You will see these icons throughout the exercises:

Icon  |Meaning
------|--------------------
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("eye", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "darkblue")`|Observe  
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("exclamation", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "red")`|Alert!  
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("pen", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "brown")`|An informative note  
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("terminal", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "black")`|Time for you to code!  
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("window-restore", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "darkgrey")`|Change to another window  
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("bookmark", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "orange")`|Remember this for later  










## Learning objectives

In this exercise you will:  

* Learn the "grammar of graphics" syntax used by {ggplot2}  
* Make simple histograms, box plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and line plotss  
* Adjust the color, fill, and shape by adjusting plot aesthetic parameters  









## Prepare  

### Prepare your script  

Open the R project, as usual, and your script "ebola_analysis.R". Create a new section below the other code, well documented with # symbols, for these exercises to create simple plots.  

### Load packages  

Add the {ggExtra} and {gghighlight} packages to the `pacman::p_load()` command at the top of your script.  

Run the code to install your R packages.  

The {ggplot2} package does not need to be listed explicitly, because it is included in the {tidyverse} mega-package (which should already be in your list of packages).  


### Import data  

Run the command at the bottom of your data cleaning code that imports the clean surveillance linelist ("surveillance_linelist_clean.rds") and saves it in R as `surv`.  













## Build a plot

Do you know much information about each district, such as the age distribution, or the number of cases? Let's build some plots that tell us more.  


### Open the plot  

Any `ggplot()` command begins with the function `ggplot()`. Within this function, the first argument is `data = `. Provide the name of the dataset to this argument.  

**Run the command below**  

```{r, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv)
```

This has "opened" the plotting canvas for us to build further plot elements.  




### Map columns to "aesthetics"  

Now that we have a canvas, we need to tell R what we want on the X-axis and on the Y-axis. The columns that we will **map** to the axes are simple examples of the plot's "aesthetics". Note this word "**aes**thetics" - the root **aes** becomes part of the next R command.  

The second argument of `ggplot()` is `mapping = aes()`. This is where you **map columns in the data to components of the plot.** Specifically, this is for components of the plot that you **allow to vary for each row of data**.  

For example, if we "map" the Y-axis to the column `age_years`, then every row in the data will be evaluated and may be placed on a different height on the Y-axis.  

### `aes()`  

The `mapping = aes()` argument is atypical in that you must provide the values to it **within the `aes()` function.**  

`mapping = aes(x = COLUMN, y = COLUMN)`  

Remember that this code above is occurring *within* the `ggplot()` function. The `mapping = aes()` itself IS the second expected argument to `ggplot()`.  

Try to write a `ggplot()` command where you map the X-axis to the column `district`, and Y-axis to the column `age_years`, and then answer the questions about the plot that appears in RStudio.

```

```{r quiz-aes-district}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - aesthetics",
  question("How many breaks are there in the X-axis?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("12"),
    answer("9"),
    answer("10", correct = T),
    answer("4")
  ),
  question("What is the default Y-axis label interval?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("5"),
    answer("20", correct = T),
    answer("30"),
    answer("10")
  )
)
```




### Add geom layers  

Now that we have our canvas, and we have designated our axes... we can begin to visualize the data!  

This is done by adding `geom_()` commands, which each create a different kind of visualization.  

We have completed one full component of the `ggplot()` command - the parentheses are closed, and the command can run without error. So how do we add additional components to the plot? 

#### **Add components of the command with +**  

The "plus" symbol connects the different lines of the `ggplot()` command. In some ways, it is like the pipe operator, but links commands *within* the ggplot.  

**Add the plus, and on the new line write `geom_point()`. Then run the command**  

<!--

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, y = age_years))+
  geom_point()
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->

You can choose to indent the new command, to indicate to a reader that it is a sub-component of the `ggplot()`, but the command will run either way.  

The `geom_point()` has visualized each row of the data frame `surv` as as points, corresponding to their `district` value (X-axis) and their `age_years` value (Y-axis).  


```{r quiz-geom-points}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - points",
  question("How many cases were reported in Central I district?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("25"),
    answer("35"),
    answer("Not possible to know", correct = T),
    answer("21")
  )
)
```

With a discrete variable on the X-axis and a continuous distribution on the Y-axis, it is difficult to know exactly how many cases there are! Each point represents one case, but you could be looking at 5 points of the same age that are overlapping and hiding each other.  

Let's try another geom to solve this problem. **Replace `geom_point()` with `geom_jitter()` and re-run the command.**  


<!--
NOTE: Below is the solution (all within details tags collapsed)
-->

<details>
<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, y = age_years))+
     geom_jitter()
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->


**Go to the Help pane of RStudio (by the Plots pane) and search for "geom_jitter" in the search bar in the upper-right**.  

This is the R documentation of the function `geom_jitter()`. Every function, whether in {base} R, or in an installed package, has documentation on its functions. You can access this documentation offline - it is stored within R once the package is downloaded.  

Sometimes, this documentation is difficult to read. We will practice reading documentation throughout the course. However, there are often tutorials, guides, and "vignettes" online that are easier to read. We will also practice reviewing these.  

For now, do the following:  

**Read the "Description"** to understand exactly what the function is doing to avoid overlapping points.  

**Review the "Aesthetics"** list near the bottom. These are other plot aesthetics that you can adjust, to vary the appearance of this geom layer.  

Within the `geom_jitter()` function, enter a few of these aesthetics and try adjusting them as follows:  

* `color = "blue"`  
* `size = 5`  
* `shape = 4`  


```{r quiz-geom-aes}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - aesthetics",
  question("What do you think the plot aesthetic `alpha` adjusts?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("Alphabetical ordering"),
    answer("Axis color"),
    answer("Transparency", correct = T),
    answer("Size")
  ),
  question("What shape is produced by setting `shape = 3` within geom_jitter()?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("Alphabetical ordering"),
    answer("Axis color"),
    answer("Transparency", correct = T),
    answer("Size")
  )
)
```


### Add more geoms  

The jitter plot is nice, but let's add some statistical display to it. **Add `geom_boxplot()` below the `geom_jitter()` command**.  


<!--

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("lightbulb", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "darkgold")` Click to read a hint</summary>
</br>

Don't forget to add a + at the end of `geom_jitter()`
</br>
</details>

     geom_jitter()+
     geom_boxplot()
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->


We can now see where summary statistical values lie for each district, such as the median and inter-quartile ranges. But the points are now hidden by the boxplots.  

**Add and adjust the `alpha = ` aesthetic for the boxplots only.** What alpha value allows you to see the plots?

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("lightbulb", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "darkgold")` Click to read a hint</summary>
</br>

Try several values between 0 and 1.  

</br>
</details>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, y = age_years))+
     geom_jitter()+
     geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5)
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->


### Violin plots  

As alternative, replace the `geom_boxplot()` with `geom_violin()`, and use the same `alpha = ` level as before to have some transparency.  

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, y = age_years))+
     geom_jitter()+
     geom_violin(alpha = 0.5)
```

There is not much difference in the case ages between each district... let's try a violin plot on another topic. Try this code:  

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = gender, y = ht_cm))+
     geom_violin(alpha = 0.5, size = 2)
```

```{r quiz-geom-violin}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - violin plot",
  question("What is aes(x = gender, y = ht_cm) doing in this command?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("Sets gender as the Y axis, and height as the X axis", message = "Almost... but check again - which axes?"),
    answer("Sets the Automated Esoteric Settings (AES)", message = "No, this does not exist."),
    answer("Sets gender as the X axis, and height as the Y axis", correct = T)
  ),
  question("What did the 'size = ' aesthetic adjust for these violin plots?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("Size of the violin"),
    answer("Size of the border line", correct = T),
    answer("Size of the plot"),
    answer("Size of the plot labels")
  )
)
```


Think about the following questions:  

* What does the violin plot communicate that the boxplot does not?  
* What does the box plot communicate that the violin plot does not?  
* What do the points show that either the box or violin plot do not?  

**What do you think is generally the best combination of these three geoms (points, boxplots, violins)?**  








## Dynamic aesthetics  

Until now, you have been editing aesthetics like `color`, `alpha`, `size`, and `shape` by assigning them to **static values** such as 3, "blue", or 0.2.  

**Now, we will assign them to columns, and the display for each point in the data will vary**  

### Boxplot fill  

Let's re-build our old boxplot, **with the aesthetic `color` statically-assigned to "blue", and `alpha` statically-assigned to 0.5**:  

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, y = age_years))+
     geom_jitter()+
     geom_boxplot(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5)
```

**Now change the command so that `fill` is assigned to the column `district`.** There are two important steps:  

1) Change the value "blue" to `district` (note the lack of quotes around `district`)  
2) Move this argument to *within* the `mapping = aes()` in the top `ggplot()` function  

Because we are assigning a *column* to the aesthetic `fill = `, it must be done within the "mapping" of the ggplot. Remember how we assigned columns to the X-axis and the Y-axis? Those assignments were dynamic as well, and they are located within the `mapping = aes()`.

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, y = age_years, fill = district))+
     geom_jitter()+
     geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5)
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->


```{r quiz-aes-dynamic}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - Dynamic aesthetic assignments",
  question("What happens if you run the command above, but replace 'blue' with the column name: district?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("The boxplots re-arrange by district"),
    answer("The boxes become the geographical shape of the district"),
    answer("The boxes fill (color) become different for each district", message = "No... this is what we wanted, but it should not have happened."),
    answer("There is an R error saying 'object district not found'", correct = T)
  ),
  question("What needs to change in order to make each boxplot a different fill?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("Try another column name"),
    answer("Move this part of the command ('fill = district') inside the aes()", correct = T),
    answer("Try the command five more times, as written"),
    answer("Restart R and try again")
  )
)
```

**If you did not move `fill = district` within the mappings, what error would you see in the R console?**  


`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("eye", style = "solid"), scale = 2, fill = "darkblue")`  

**Note the legend that has automatically appeared on the right side of the plot**.  

How have missing values been treated in this plot? How are they marked? Which color was automatically assigned to them? Where in the order do they appear, along the X-axis and in the legend?  


### Point color  


**How would you change the color of the points?**  

Be aware of this nuance: For geoms that have *area*, such as box plots, histograms, and bar plots, the *inside* color is changed with the `fill` aesthetic. However, the color appearance of points (including `geom_jitter()`) are changed with the aesthetic `color`.  

**Change the color of the points to also vary by district, and set the box plot's `alpha = 0`**.

```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->

**Now, remove the `color = district` from the `mapping = aes()`** - return the points to their original black.  




## Labels (and indenting)  

Let's add a few quick labels to make our box plot more clear.  


**Add `labs()` to the bottom of the command** (using a + symbol), and provide the following arguments within the function:  

* `title = "My title`  
* `subtitle = "Subtitle here"` 
* `x = "District"`  
* `y = "Age (years)"`  
* `caption = "Among an Ebola outbreak, 2014"`  
* `fill = "District"`

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(                                             # open the ggplot

    x = district,                                      # district on the x-axis
    y = age_years,                                     # age on the y-axis
    fill = district))+                                 # fill of boxplots by district
geom_jitter()+                                      # add jittered points  
geom_boxplot(                                       # add boxplots, semi-transparent
  alpha = 0.5)+
labs(                                               # add labels to plot
  title = "My title",
  subtitle = "Subtitle here",
  x = "District",
  y = "Age (years)",
  caption = "Among an Ebola outbreak, 2014",
  fill = "District"
  )
```

</br>
</details>
<!--

-->


**Now look at the solution code above - ** What is different about it, aside from the new `labs()` command?  

It has been written in a "longer" format. For any parentheses, arguments are written after a newline and an indent. This can be read more easily, like a Table of Contents:  

* ggplot(  
     * dataset  
     * column mappings (
          * x-axis  
          * y-axis  
          * fill  ))+  
* geom_jitter()+  
* geom_boxplot(
     alpha )+
* labs(
     * title  
     * subtitle  
     * x axis label  
     * y axis label  
     * caption  
     * legend

The indenting and newlines will not impact the execution of the code, but now you have space on the right to add # comments.  

While it can take more time to write detailed comments, it can really help people in the future who are reading your code and wondering what you are doing (including for yourself in the future!).

## Bar plots  


Now that you have explored points, jittered points, boxplots, and violins, let's try some other **geoms**:  

  

A bar plot could be used to show the number of cases reported in each district.  

**Try a command using the geom `geom_bar()`.**  

Note that you should only supply an `x = ` aesthetic - there is no need for `y = ` as the number of rows in the dataset will be counted individually.

</br>

In this new ggplot command, remove the `geom_jitter()` and `geom_boxplot()` commands. Replace them with one `geom_bar()` command.  

</br>

</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district))+
     geom_bar()
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->

The rows in the data have now been displayed as a bar plot!  

Can you change the bars to all be the color "lightblue" using the `fill` argument? (think: where should this argument be placed, seeing as "lightblue" is an assignment to a static value)  





### Set the fill aesthetic dynamically  

The previous plot examined age as a continuous variable (on the Y-axis).  

**How would we show the age distribution using the bar plot?**  

**Change the plot so that the `fill` aesthetic is assigned dynamically, to a *categorical* column in the dataset**.  


<!--
NOTE: Below is the hint (all within details tags collapsed)

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("lightbulb", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "darkgold")` Click to read a hint</summary>
</br>

Assign `fill` to the column `age_cat`.  

</br>
</details>

<!--
NOTE: Below is the solution (all within details tags collapsed)

<details>
<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, fill = age_cat))+
  geom_bar()
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->

Now we can see the age categories in the legend, and bars are "stacked".  


### Order of stacked bars  

**What if you want to reverse the order of the bars?**  

Perhaps you want the youngest age category on the bottom: we'll give you this code:  

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, fill = fct_rev(age_cat)))+
  geom_bar()
```

In the above code we've used the `fct_rev()` function, which comes from the {forcats} package. We'll explain more later, but this package contains functions that create explicit ordering of values. By wrapping the `fct_rev()` around the column `age_cat`, ggplot reverses the default ordering of that variable.  

If the colors look ugly to you, don't worry. We'll learn later how to adjust the colors.  

### Adjacent bars  

`geom_bar()` accepts the argument `position = `, which can be assigned to the value "dodge". Try to add this argument to `geom_bar()` and see what happens (don't forget the quotation marks).

</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = district, fill = age_cat))+
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->



### Bar plots from count data  

Until now, we have used our surveillance linelist to create these plots. The plots are treating each row as one data point. For example, in the bar plot, each row has been stacked on top of the others.  

But often we have to deal with datasets that arrive as counts (e.g. weekly number of malaria cases reported by each county). This can happen also if a particular reporting facility is overwhelmed and can no longer report detailed case information.  

To explain how to handle these data, we will first practice the skills from the previous module, by creating a counts dataset:  

**Create a new dataset that includes only the total case counts *per district*.** Use your knowledge of the {dplyr} functions `group_by()` and `summarise()` to do this, and **save the data frame as `case_counts_district`**.  


<!--
NOTE: Below is the hint (all within details tags collapsed)
-->
<details>

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("lightbulb", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "darkgold")` Click to read a hint</summary>
</br>

Begin with the `surv` data frame and pipe into `group_by(district)`. Then, `summarise()` and create a column in the new summary data frame that is created using `n()` (to return the total number of rows in each district group).  

</br>
</details>

<!--
NOTE: Below is the solution (all within details tags collapsed)
-->

<details>
<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = T, echo=T}
case_counts_district <- surv %>% 
  group_by(district) %>% 
  summarise(n_cases = n())
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->



```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
case_counts_district %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```


When your data use counts, do not use `geom_bar()`. `geom_bar()` records one bar segment for each **row** of data.  

Try running this command and see what the result is (note the changed dataset):  

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = case_counts_district, mapping = aes(x = district))+
  geom_bar()
```

That is not the plot we want! How to fix this?  

1) Add the aesthetic `y = n_cases` within the ggplot mappings. This is assigning the *bar height* to the numeric count value.  
2) Change `geom_bar()` to `geom_col()`  

Now run the command. It should look exactly the same as the default `geom_col()` command, when used on the `surv` dataset.  


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = case_counts_district, mapping = aes(x = district, y = n_cases))+
  geom_col()
```

Try adjusting the `fill =` aesthetic. Can you assign it dynamically to another column? Which columns are available to you, in this new data frame?  





## Scatter plots  

**Write a new `ggplot()` command that uses the `surv` surveillance linelist**. Use `geom_point()`, and two continuous variables: `age_years` and `ht_cm` assigned to the X-axis and Y-axis, respectively.  

Next, add the aesthetic `color = ` and assign it dynamically to the column `age_cat`.  



<!--

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("lightbulb", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "darkgold")` Click to read a hint</summary>
</br>

Color of points is adjusted with the `color = ` aesthetic (`fill` is for shapes like bars and histograms). Be sure to place this assignment *within* the `mapping = aes()`  

</br>
</details>

</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = age_years, y = ht_cm, color = age_cat))+
  geom_point()
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->


This looks pretty, but is not actually that useful. Yet, it does serve to show that the age categories are aligning with the continuous values.  


What if you dynamically assign the aesthetic `color = ` to the column `gender`? Are you able to see any pattern in the data? It is still difficult.  





### ggplot extension packages  

Try this advanced R code below. There is a package {ggExtra} that provides several functions that add functionality to ggplots.  

**Add this function to your list of packages to load, and re-run your {pacman} command so that this package installs and loads for use.**  

Now, run the command below:  

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
height_plot <- ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = age_years, y = ht_cm, color = gender))+
  geom_point()

ggMarginal(height_plot)
```

What is happening above?  

1) We have *assigned* the ggplot command a name ("height_plot") and saved it as an object. Look, it appears in the R Environment now.  

2) A second command uses the {ggExtra} function `ggMarginal()`. This is a function that draws distributions in the "margins" (outsides) of the plot.  
     * The first argument takes the name of our pre-defined plot.  

Now run the command again, but with the `groupFill = TRUE` argument specified. 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
ggMarginal(height_plot, groupFill = TRUE)
```


```{r quiz-scatter}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - Scatterplots",
  question("In the ggMarginal command, the term 'height_plot' is referring to what exactly?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("A setting that determines how tall the plot output is"),
    answer("It ensures that the plot has height"),
    answer("height_plot is the name of a ggplot saved in a prior command", correct = T),
    answer("This is an argument that does not need to be specified'")
  ),
  question("What do the grouped marginal distributions show about the heights of male and female cases?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("That the male cases are generally taller than the female cases", correct = T),
    answer("That at a given age, male cases are taller than female cases", message = "No, we do not know this from these plots. We only know the overall distribution of the data."),
    answer("The cases are more likely to be male than female", message = "No, the distributions do not tell us anything about whether cases are more likely to be male or female.")
  ),
  question("What is ggMarginal()?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("A function of the {ggplot2} package"),
    answer("A function of the package {ggExtra} that can be used in coordination with {ggplot2} functions", correct = T),
    answer("A {base} R function")
  )
)
```


### Add smoothed means to a scatterplot  

**Finally, try another scatterplot, using `date_report` on the X-axis and `diff` on the Y-axis. Add `geom_smooth()` to see a trend line.  

<!--

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = date_report, y = diff))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->

Go again the **Help** RStudio pane (near the plots pane in the lower-right). Type `geom_smooth` in the search bar. Read the "Details" section to understand exactly what `geom_smooth()` does to produce it's line and confidence interval.  








## Histogram  

Histograms are used to show the distribution of **continuous** variables. If you have a column with numbers, or dates, it is better to use `geom_histogram()` (not `geom_bar()` or `geom_col()`).  

### Basic histogram syntax  

We will cover Epidemic Curves in depth in a later module, but for now:  

**Make a basic date histogram by assigning the X-axis to the column `date_onset`. Change it's default coloring to "darkgreen"**  




<!--
NOTE: Below is the hint (all within details tags collapsed)

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("lightbulb", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "darkgold")` Click to read a hint</summary>
</br>

For `geom_histogram()`, the color of the "bars" is actually the `fill`. Adjust it by assigning `fill = `. If assigning to a static color, the assignment should be made *outside* of `aes()` (within `geom_histogram()`).  


</br>
</details>

<!--

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = date_onset))+
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkgreen")
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->


### Warnings and Errors  

Look in your R console, where the command is printed that you ran. Do you see a warning, written in red?  

In R, a **"warning"** is given if R was able to execute your command, but it encountered something unexpected that it thinks you should know.  

In contrast, an **"error"** means that R was unable to execute your command.  


```{r quiz-warning}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - histogram warning",
  question("What does this warning mean (Removed 35 rows containing non-finite values)",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("That 35 of the cases had an infinitely bad sense of humor"),
    answer("35 of the cases had date values outside the range of the plot", message = "We have not set any limits to the plot axis, so R will display all values possible."),
    answer("That 35 of the cases had missing date_onset values and so could not be plotted.", correct = T),
    answer("That ggplot just removed 35 rows from your linelist data frame", message = "ggplot will not alter the contents of your dataset.")
  )
)
```



### Stacked histograms  

**Now try making a histogram for the column `age_years`, with `fill` assigned dynamically to `gender`.**  


<!--
NOTE: Below is the solution (all within details tags collapsed)
-->

<details>
<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>


```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = age_years, fill = gender))+
  geom_histogram()
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->



You now have "stacked" histograms. These can be difficult to interpret sometimes, but are a useful tool to have.  


### Histogram breaks  

Histograms show "bars", but there is no space between the bars. This is because the variable is continuous. Still, the size and frequency of the **"histogram bins"** can be adjusted.  

**Try running the histogram with the following adjustments (one at a time):**  

* `bins = 100` within `geom_histogram()`  
* `bins = 5` within `geom_histogram()`  
* `bin_width = 5` within `geom_histogram()`

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>


```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = age_years, fill = gender))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 100)

ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = age_years, fill = gender))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 5)

ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = age_years, fill = gender))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->



## Facets  

That stacked histogram can be difficult to interpret. **Faceting** in R is the process of creating one smaller plot for each unique level of a variable (also called "small-multiples").  

This is done by adding the command `facet_wrap()` to the ggplot command. Within this function, write a tilde (~) and the name of the faceting column on the right side.  

**Try to facet this histogram by `gender` (leave `fill = gender` as well).**  

<!--
NOTE: Below is the solution (all within details tags collapsed)
-->

<details>
<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check", style = "solid"), scale = 1, fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>


```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = age_years, fill = gender))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)+
  facet_wrap(~ gender)

```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->



**Now try another plot: instead of `gender`, set the plot to be faceted by `district`.** You can choose to remove the `fill = gender`, for clarity. It will not have an impact on the faceting.  



```{r quiz-facets}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - facets",
  question("Which district had the earliest cases?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("West I"),
    answer("East II"),
    answer("West III", correct = T),
    answer("Central I")
  )
)
```


You can read more about faceting in [this section of the Epi R Handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/ggplot-basics.html#ggplot_basics_facet).  




## gghighlight  

Just like {ggExtra}, the package {gghighlight} is an extension that works with {ggplot2} to add functionalities for your plotting.  

Go to your **Help** pane in RStudio, and type in "gghighlight". Ensure that you have already installed the package.  

**Read the documentation.**

```{r quiz-gghighlight}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - gghighlight",
  question("When was the package documentation created?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("2021-01-01"),
    answer("1999-04-03"),
    answer("2021-06-05", correct = T),
    answer("2022-03-12")
  ),
    question("The author believe's that this package is the equivalent of which function, but for ggplot2?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("select()", message = "Look at the bottom of the Motivation section"),
    answer("filter()", correct = T),
    answer("mutate()", message = "Look at the bottom of the Motivation section"),
    answer(" %>% ", message = "Look at the bottom of the Motivation section")
  ),
    question("What is the main function of the {gghighlight} package?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("flair()", message = "Look at the section called gghighlight()"),
    answer("stark()", message = "Look at the section called gghighlight()"),
    answer("gghighlight()", correct = T),
    answer("highlighter()", message = "Look at the section called gghighlight()")
  ),
    question("Select all the geoms have labels automatically added by gghighlight()?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("points", correct = T),
    answer("lines", correct = T),
    answer("bars", correct = T)
  )
)
```


Now, **make a histogram using the following settings:**  

* The histogram is of `date_onset`  
* The color (`fill`) is by `district`  
* Faceting by district  
* Add `gghighlight()`  

Finally, make a variation of this plot:  

* No faceting  
* The `gghighlight()` only highlights the cases from "West II"
