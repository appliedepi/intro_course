## Introduction to R for Applied Epidemiology and Public Health


### Welcome

Welcome to the live course "Introduction to R for applied epidemiologists", offered by [Applied Epi](www.appliedepi.org) - a nonprofit organisation that offers open-source tools, training, and support to frontline public health practitioners.  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/logo.png", error = F)
```

### Data visualization  

This exercise focuses on **scales and themes in {ggplot2}**.

### Format

This exercise will guide you through a set of tasks.  
*You should perform these tasks in RStudio and on your local computer*.  

#### Getting Help  

There are several ways to get help:  

1) Look for the "helpers" (see below)
2) Ask your live course instructor/facilitator for help  
3) Ask a colleague or other participant in the course for tips  
4) Post a question in [Applied Epi Community](www.community.appliedepi.org) in the category for questions about Applied Epi Training  

Here is what those "helpers" will look like:

#### Quiz questions  

Please complete the quiz questions that you encounter throughout the tutorial. **Answering will help you** to comprehend the material, and will also help us to improve the exercises for future students.  

To practice, please answer the following questions:  


```{r quiz-use-helper, echo=F}
quiz(
  question_radio("When should I view the red 'helper' code?",
    answer("After trying to write the code myself", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Before I try coding", correct = FALSE),
    correct = "Reviewing best-practice code after trying to write yourself can help you improve",
    incorrect = "Please attempt the exercise yourself, or use the hint, before viewing the answer."
  )
)
```


```{r quiz-anxious, echo = FALSE}
question_numeric(
 "How anxious are you about beginning this tutorial - on a scale from 1 (least anxious) to 10 (most anxious)?",
 answer(10, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(9, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(8, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(7, message = "Try not to worry, we will help you succeed!", correct = T),
 answer(6, message = "Ok, we will get there together", correct = T),
 answer(5, message = "Ok, we will get there together", correct = T),
 answer(4, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 answer(3, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 answer(2, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 answer(1, message = "I like your confidence!", correct = T),
 allow_retry = TRUE,
 correct = "Thanks for sharing. ",
 min = 1,
 max = 10,
 step = 1
)
```



#### Icons  

You will see these icons throughout the exercises:

Icon  |Meaning
------|--------------------
`r fontawesome::fa("eye", fill = "darkblue")`|Observe  
`r fontawesome::fa("exclamation", fill = "red")`|Alert!  
`r fontawesome::fa("pen", fill = "brown")`|An informative note  
`r fontawesome::fa("terminal", fill = "black")`|Time for you to code!  
`r fontawesome::fa("window-restore", fill = "darkgrey")`|Change to another window  
`r fontawesome::fa("bookmark", fill = "orange")`|Remember this for later  










## Learning objectives

In this exercise you will:  

* Practice adjusting the scales commands within {ggplot2}  
* Make adjustments to the themes of ggplots  
* Save ggplots as PNG files  









## Prepare  

### Prepare your script  

Open the R project, as usual, and your script "ebola_analysis.R".  

### Load packages  

Add the following R packages to your {pacman} command at the top of your script:  

* {RColorBrewer}  
* {viridis}  
* {scales}  

Run the code to install your R packages.  


### Run previous code  

If you left RStudio since the previous exercise, clear your environment and then re-run all code in your script in order to again use the cleaned `surv` dataset. If you encounter errors, you always have the option of importing the clean dataset from "data/clean" subfolder.  





## Color scales  

Scale commands replace defaults of how the aesthetic mappings manifest, such as:  

* Which colors or shapes to display  
* The min/max of point sizes  
* The min/max and frequency of axes breaks  

As a generic formula, these commands are written as: `scale_AESTHETIC_METHOD()`.  

1. `scale_` : this prefix never changes  
2. AESTHETIC: `_fill_` , `_color_` , `_x_` , `_y_` , etc.  
3. METHOD: `_continuous()`, `_discrete()`, `_manual()`, `_date()`, etc.  

Some examples of scale commands:  

You want to adjust  |Scale command  
----------------------|-------------------  
continuous y-axis   |`scale_y_continuous()`  
date x-axis         |`scale_x_date()`  
categorical x-axis  |`scale_x_discrete()`  
fill, continuous    |`scale_fill_continuous()`  
fill, continuous    |`scale_fill_gradient()`  
color, manual assignment|`scale_color_manual()`  



Here we show two different ways to create a continuous color gradient.  

* The `scale_*_continuous` functions work with pre-built gradient palettes  
* `scale_*_gradient()` creates a 2 color gradient  
* `scale_*_gradient2` allows you to also set a midpoint color between these two  
* `scale_gradient_n()` allows you to create more complex palettes.  

More information on these functions is [available here](r-graphics.org/recipe-colors-palette-continuous).



### Default color scales

```{r, eval=F, echo=T, warning = F, message = F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = district,
    fill = gender)) +
geom_bar()
```

Above, the fill of a bar plot uses the **default colors and axis breaks**. We can adjust the elements of this plot with a `scale_AESTHETIC_METHOD()` function added (`+`) to the end of our `ggplot()`

### Adjust fill

Here we adjust the *fill* color of the bars *manually* (`scale_fill_manual()`). We provide assignments to the values in our dataset ("male" and "female") within a vector (`c()`). To assign a color to the `NA` values we need to specify this with the separate argument `na.value = `

```{r, eval=F, echo=T, warning = F, message = F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = district,
    fill = gender)) +
geom_bar() +
scale_fill_manual(        
  values = c(
   "male" = "violetred", 
   "female" = "aquamarine"),
   na.value = "green")
```

Here we have chosen some ugly colors to highlight what we are changing! Try changing the color for "male" to "dodgerblue" and "female" to "tomato" for a nicer color combination in the code below. Also set NA to be "grey", a common standard plot color.

<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r fontawesome::fa("check", fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = district,
    fill = gender)) +
geom_bar() +
scale_fill_manual(        
  values = c(
    "male" = "dodgerblue",
    "female" = "tomato"),
  na.value = "grey")
```

</br>
</details>
<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->


Note that the character values you put in the vector `c()` need to match the vales in the data *exactly* (e.g. "Male" is NOT the same as "male").  



#### Built-in color scales  

{ggplot2} and the package {RColorBrewer} offers a number of pre-configured palettes for color scales that are continuous, discrete, diverging, etc.  

As we are working here with discrete data we can use the function `scale_fill_brewer()` to access the following palettes rather than specifying our own colors:

```{R brewerpal, fig.height=8}
RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all()

```

As we are working with a discrete scale, the middle group of color palettes are most appropriate. Below we select the palette "Pastel2", and specify that missing values should be "grey". 

```{r brewer_eg, eval= F, echo=T, warning = F, message = F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = district,
    fill = gender)) +
geom_bar() +
scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel2",
                  na.value = "grey")
```

A color-blind friendly palette is available as well. This comes in discrete and continuous forms `scale_fill_viridis_d()` and `scale_fill_viridis_c()`:

```{r viridis_eg, eval= F, echo=T, warning = F, message = F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = district,
    fill = gender)) +
geom_bar() +
scale_fill_viridis_d(na.value = "grey")
```

**Adjust the ggplot command above to use `age_cat` instead of `gender`.** How do the brewer and viridis_d color scales look with more categories?  

```{r quiz-brewer}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - color brewer",
  question("What color is the age group 10-19 using scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Pastel2')?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("green"),
    answer("yellow"),
    answer("orange", correct = T),
    answer("brown")
  ),
  question("What is the importance of the '_fill_' in the commands?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("It instructs the plot to be filled joy"),
    answer("Because this is a bar plot, fill is the aesthetic that produces the colors in the bars", correct = T),
    answer("It sets the background color (grey)"),
    answer("It adjusts the spaces between the bars")
  )
)
```


### Continuous color scales  

Try applying what you have learned to add a *continuous* viridis palette to the following plot. Be aware that here we are dealing with a *color* rather than *fill* aesthetic because we use `geom_point()`. It is best practice to also specify an `na.value = `

```{r, eval=F, echo=T, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = age_years,
    y = wt_kg,
    color = temp)) +
geom_point() 
```

</br>

```{r manual-color, echo=T, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = age_years,
    y = wt_kg,
    color = temp)) +
geom_point() +
scale_color_viridis_c(na.value = "grey")
```

</br>
</details>

<!--

-->

Here are some further resources for you:  

[Viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) (try with `option = "plasma"` or "inferno"), and [colorbrewer](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/38-rcolorbrewers-palettes.html) palette functions can be added to any ggplot.  




## Axes scales  


We can edit axes in a similar way, with similar commands.  

### Adjusting Y-axis  

In a barplot such as the one below, we have a continuous Y-axis and discrete X-axis. Here we might decide that the counts on the Y-axis are not descriptive enough so we wish to supply our own break points.  

```{r axis-breaks, eval= T, echo=T, warning = F, message = F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = district,
    fill = gender)) +
geom_bar() +
scale_fill_viridis_d(na.value = "grey")
```


In `scale_y_continuous()` we adjust the Y-axis breaks using `seq()` to define a numeric sequence.  

**Try running the command `seq(from = 0, to = 250, by = 25)` in the R Console, just to see the result.** Try it again with different argument values.  

Now, add the function `scale_y_continuous()`. Inside this function, set the argument `breaks = ` to `seq()` as written above.

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = district,
    fill = gender)) +
geom_bar() +
scale_fill_viridis_d(na.value = "grey") +
scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0,
                                to = 250,
                                by = 25))
```

</br>
</details>

<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->



### Starting scales at 0 

You may have noticed that {ggplot2} has a behavior of expanding your axis beyond the data, with a gap between the values and the axis at the bottom. This can be fixed with the axes scales using the `expand = ` argument.

Using the previous ggplot command, add a second argument to `scale_y_continuous()` that is `expand = c(0,0)`. This is telling `ggplot()` to start the Y-axis at the plot coordinates (0,0) with no buffer space.  



<!--
NOTE: Below is the solution (all within details tags collapsed)
-->

<details>
<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r fontawesome::fa("check", fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>


```{r axis-end, echo=T, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = district,
    fill = gender)) +
geom_bar() +
scale_fill_viridis_d(na.value = "grey") +
scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0,
                                to = 250,
                                by = 25),
                   expand = c(0,0))
```

</br>
</details>

<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->


Try applying the same `expand = c(0,0)` syntax to the *discrete* x-axis, by adding `scale_x_discrete()`:

-->

<details>
<summary style='text-decoration: underline; color: red;'>`r fontawesome::fa("check", fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try it yourself first!)</summary>
</br>




```{r expand-solution, echo=T, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = district,
    fill = gender)) +
geom_bar() +
scale_fill_viridis_d(na.value = "grey") +
scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0,
                                to = 250,
                                by = 25),
                   expand = c(0,0)) +
scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0,0))
```

</br>
</details>

<!--
NOTE: End of solution
-->


### Flip axes  

Finally, we can flip the X and Y axes by adding `coord_flip()` (with empty parentheses). This is useful in bar charts so that more discrete value names can be displayed without overlapping each other on the x-axis.  

```{r flip-axes, echo=T, eval= TRUE, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = district,
    fill = gender)) +
geom_bar() +
scale_fill_viridis_d(na.value = "grey") +
scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0,
                                to = 250,
                                by = 25),
                   expand = c(0,0)) +
scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0,0))+
coord_flip()
```

Note that if adjusting the labels with `labs()` you still edit `x = ` to adjust the label that now appears on the y-axis.  





## Date axis labels  

Date axes also have scales that can be adjusted with `scale_*()` functions.  

The default scale for date axis labels will vary by the range of your data. Here is an example plot:

```{r date-x, eval= F, echo=T, warning = F, message = F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(x = date_onset)) +
geom_histogram()
```

Adjust axis labels with `scale_x_date()`.


### Manual date breaks  

Within `scale_x_date()`, you can use the argument `date_breaks=` to provide values like "1 week", "2 weeks", or "3 months". 

Note: these are the *axis* label breaks, the don't affect the bins of the histogram (bar widths), We will discuss best practices for setting the binwidths of histograms for epidemic curves in a subsequent module.  

Try editing this code so that the date labels appear every 2 months:

```{r date-break, eval=F, echo=T, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(x = date_onset)) +
geom_histogram()
```

ggplot(

scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 months")
```

</br>
</details>

<!--

-->



```{r quiz-date-breaks}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - date breaks",
  question("What is the default date format displayed when setting 'date_breaks =' ?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("MM/DD/YYYY"),
    answer("DD/MM/YYYY"),
    answer("YYYY-MM-DD", correct = T),
    answer("YYYY-DD-MM")
  )
)
```




### Date axis labels

You (or your supervisor) may not like the date labels appearing as YYYY-MM-DD.  

You can specify the date labels format with the additional argument `date_labels = `.  

This argument accepts a *character value* (within quotes), constructed using ["strptime" syntax - see R documentation for more information on this](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/strptime)  

For example: the value `"%d %b %Y"` will change the display to DD MMM YYYY (note spaces instead of dashes). You can also trigger a new line with `\n`, e.g. to move the year below the day and month.

```{r date-labs, eval= F, echo = T, warning = F, message = F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(x = date_onset)) +
geom_histogram() +
scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 months",
             date_labels = "%d %b \n %Y" )
```

Here is the complete list of strptime abbreviations:  

* %d = Day number of month (5, 17, 28, etc.)  
* %j = Day number of the year (Julian day 001-366)  
* %a = Abbreviated weekday (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.)  
* %A = Full weekday (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)  
* %w = Weekday number (0-6, Sunday is 0)  
* %u = Weekday number (1-7, Monday is 1)  
* %W = Week number (00-53, Monday is week start)  
* %U = Week number (01-53, Sunday is week start)  
* %m = Month number (e.g. 01, 02, 03, 04)  
* %b = Abbreviated month (Jan, Feb, etc.)  
* %B = Full month (January, February, etc.)  
* %y = 2-digit year (e.g. 89)  
* %Y = 4-digit year (e.g. 1989)  
* %h = hours (24-hr clock)  
* %m = minutes  
* %s = seconds  
* %z = offset from GMT  
* %Z = Time zone (character)

### Auto-efficient date axes  

There is also a built-in simplification for date labels using the {scales} package.  

Confusingly this is applied using the `labels = ` rather than `date_labels = ` argument. Assigning `labels = ` to `label_date_short()`. This produces date axis labels that automatically show the least amount of informaton necessary to convey changes in month, year, etc. It is very nice!  

You can read the {scales} documentation [here](https://scales.r-lib.org/) or in your Help pane. It has many useful functions.  

```{r date-short-labs, eval= F, echo = T, warning = F, message = F}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(x = date_onset)) +
geom_histogram() +
scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 months",
             labels = label_date_short() )
```

**Using the code above, adjust the `date_breaks =` value to "2 weeks"**. What happens and how does `label_date_short()` adjust to account for this?  




## Display percents  

The {scales} package that you just learned about has another useful function, `percent()`, that can adjust axes to fluidly display percents, even though they are decimals in the data.  

If you were to modify the values in your data to display the character symbol "%", then your values would become characters themselves! As you know, `"36"` is different from `36`. And on an axis, it will not sort intuitively if it is a character.  

Thankfully, we have the `percent()` function.  

We can easily display proportions as percents with `percent()` from **scales** within `scale_y_continuous()`. 

To test this, let's create a dataset using `group_by()` and `summarise()` that creates a proportion - the *weekly proportion of cases that have more than 7 days delay between symptom onset and their report date*.  

```{r CFR, echo = T, eval = T}
delay_1wk <- surv %>%                                      # begin with surveillance linelist
  mutate(diff_1wk = as.numeric(diff) > 7) %>%              # create column that is TRUE is diff is greater than 7
  group_by(week = floor_date(date_report, "week")) %>%     # create column "week" and group by it  
  summarise(                                               # begin summarise command     
    cases = n(),                                           # number of cases in the week
    delayed = sum(diff_1wk == TRUE, na.rm=T),              # number of delayed cases in the week 
    delayed_pct = delayed / cases)                         # calculate proportion
```


This new summary dataset looks like this:  

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
delay_1wk %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```


Write a ggplot command using `geom_line()` that has the following settings:  

* Uses the `delay_1wk` dataset  
* `week` on the X-axis  
* `delayed_pct` on the Y-axis  
* `size = 2` and `color = "brown" `within `geom_line()`

```{r quiz-percent-scale}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - Y-axis percent scale",
  question("Which scale_*() command should you use to adjust this y-axis?",
    allow_retry = T,
    answer("scale_x_discrete()"),
    answer("scale_fill_continuous()"),
    answer("scale_y_continuous()", correct = T),
    answer("scale_color_discrete()")
  )
)
```

**Now, apply the appropriate `scale_*()` function, and include the argument `labels = percent`.** Note that when setting this argument equal to a function, you do not need to include the parentheses at the end of `percent()`.  



```{r , echo = TRUE, eval = F, warning = F, message = F}
ggplot(data = delay_1wk, mapping = aes(x = week, y = delayed_pct))+
  geom_line(size = 2, color = "brown")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent)
```














## Plot labels  


### Static labels  

Let us continue using the data frame and plot from the previous section:  

```{r , echo = TRUE, eval = F, warning = F, message = F}
ggplot(data = delay_1wk, mapping = aes(x = week, y = delayed_pct))+
  geom_line(size = 2, color = "brown")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent)
```


Add a caption that reads: "n = 663. Report produced on 2022-04-02. Data collected from 5 major hospitals in the epidemic-affected area. Last reported case on 2014-12-21. 7 cases missing date of onset."  

But! - Make each sentence start on a new line.

```

</br>

### Dynamic labels  

The caption as written will work... for this particular moment and dataset. But what happens if you get an updated dataset? The caption is static and will remain the same.  

The {stringr} package contains the package `str_glue()`, which allows us to *embed code within character strings*, so that the strings will update with new data.  

To use this function, first, wrap the character string within `str_glue()`, like this:  `str_glue("n = 663")`. This will print the static number 663.  

To make it dynamically reflect the number of rows in the data frame `surv`, you can insert curly brackets *within the quotation marks*. Within the brackets, insert your R code, for example, the function `nrow()`    

* `str_glue("n = {nrow(surv)}")` (Try running this in your R console)  

Within the quotation marks, you can continue your writing, and even include other sections of code:  

* `str_glue("n = {nrow(surv)} confirmed cases. There are {ncol(surv)} columns in the data frame")` (Try running this in your R console)  

Now you see the power of this...  there are some other functions to help you craft an excellent caption:  

* `unique()` A {base} R function that returns the of unique values, such as `unique(surv$district)`  
     * Combine this with `length()` to return the *number* of unique values: `length(unique(surv$district))`
* `Sys.Date()` Returns the current time as per your computer. Do not put anything in the parentheses.  
* `fmt_count()` is a function from the package {epikit} that if provided a data frame and logical criteria, will return a nicely formatted statement of the number of observations. For example:  
     * `fmt_count(surv, is.na(hospital))` (try running this in your R console)  
     
**Now that you have these tools, revise your 4-sentence caption so that the numbers will all automatically update.**

ggplot(data = delay_1wk, mapping = aes(x = week, y = delayed_pct))+
  geom_line(size = 2, color = "brown")+
  labs(caption = str_glue("n = {nrow(surv)}.\nReport produced on {Sys.Date()}\nData collected from {length(unique(surv$hospital))-2} major hospitals in the epidemic-affected area.\nLast reported case on {max(surv$date_report, na.rm = TRUE)}.\n{fmt_count(surv, is.na(date_report))} cases missing date of onset and not shown."))
```

Did you catch that `unique()` will also count the values `NA` and "Other"? You may want to subtract 2 from that calculation.

Once your captions get very complex, you can arrange the `str_glue()` in a different way, so that it is easier to read and manage. The code is separated and placed towards the bottom, with placeholders in the text itself. See this section of the [Epi R Handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/characters-and-strings.html?q=str_glue#dynamic-strings).  





## Theme elements

Themes are non-data design features (background, text size/color, etc).  

### Complete themes

[These "complete themes"](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html) are easy to add.  

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# Try one of these...
+ theme_bw()
+ theme_classic()
+ theme_dark()
+ theme_gray()
+ theme_minimal()
+ theme_light()
+ theme_void()
```

**Try adding them to some of your former plots.**  

Try the argument `base_size = 16` inside the theme function, to quickly increase text sizes.  

`r fontawesome::fa("bookmark", fill = "orange")` Which one do you prefer? Mentally bookmark to use later!  



### Micro-adjustments to themes  


Micro-adjustments to the theme can be made with `theme()`. As these are mostly small layout and visual details we won't go into much detail here. More information is available [in the Epi R Handbook](https://www.epirhandbook.com/en/ggplot-basics.html#ggplot_basics_themes).  

The syntax for themes takes time to learn and is not used often enough to commit to memory for most R users. See [this list](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html) of feature-specific arguments. Or run, `theme_get()` in your R window to get a list of all theme arguments in the console.  


Copy and paste this example below into RStudio (theme micro-adjustments at the bottom). There is no need to type it, as that would take a long time. The purpose is just for your to see.  

```{r theme-adjustment, echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
ggplot(data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = age_years,
    y = ht_cm,
    color = gender)) +
geom_point(
  alpha = 0.7) +
scale_color_brewer(
  palette = "Pastel2",
  na.value = "grey") +
labs(
  title = "Height and age",
  subtitle = "All hospitals",
  x = "Age (years)",
  y = "Height (cm)",
  caption = "Fictional Ebola data",
  color = "Gender"
) +
theme_classic(base_size = 16) +
theme(
  legend.position = "bottom",                # move legend to bottom
  plot.title = element_text(color = "red",   # title color
                            size = 20,       # title font size
                            face = "bold"),  # title typeface
  axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0))    # rotate y axis title to be horizontal
```

These theme elements follow a similar 2-part syntax much like `mapping = aes()` where we pass a function to an argument of a higher level function (here `theme()`).

**Remember to add any adjustments *after* any pre-built themes**

Some useful theme options are presented below:

`theme()` argument                  |	What it adjusts
------------------------------------|-------------------
`plot.title = element_text()`       |	The title
`plot.subtitle = element_text()`    |	The subtitle
`plot.caption = element_text()`     |	The caption (family, face, color, size, angle, vjust, hjust…)
`axis.title = element_text()`       |	Axis titles (both x and y) (size, face, angle, color…)
`axis.title.x = element_text()`     |	Axis title x-axis only (use .y for y-axis only)
`axis.text = element_text()`        |	Axis text (both x and y)
`axis.text.x = element_text()`      |	Axis text x-axis only (use .y for y-axis only)
`axis.ticks = element_blank()`      |	Remove axis ticks
`axis.line = element_line()`        |	Axis lines (colour, size, linetype: solid dashed dotted etc)
`strip.text = element_text()`       |	Facet strip text (colour, face, size, angle…)
`strip.background = element_rect()` |	facet strip (fill, colour, size…)


The main adjustments you are likely to make regularly are to do with the plot `legend.position = `. Default options are `"top"`, `"bottom"`, `"left"`, `"right"` and `"none"` (to hide the legend completely).  

The legend position can also be set more specifically with `c(x,y)` where x and y refer to the position along the x or y axis as a proportion of the total length (ie. bottom right is c(1,0))

Most other theme elements can also be turned off using `element_blank()` e.g. to turn off minor y-axis grid lines and legend title:

Check your understanding of the basics of themes below:

```{r themes-quiz}
quiz(
  question("Should adjustments to the theme be made before or after setting one of the prebuilt complete themes?",
    answer("before"),
    answer("after", correct = TRUE)
  ),
  question("Which of the following are prebuilt complete themes in ggplot?",
    answer("theme_bw()", correct = TRUE),
    answer("theme_classic()", correct = TRUE),
    answer("theme_red()"),
    answer("scale_color_brewer()")
  ),
  question("How would you hide a legend in ggplot?",
    answer("theme(legend.title = 'element.blank()')"),
    answer("theme(legend.position = 'right')"),
    answer("theme(legend.position(`none`))"),
    answer("theme(legend.position = 'none')", correct = TRUE)
  ),
  question("How would you set your legend to appear in the centre of your graph?",
    answer("theme(legend.position = 'middle')"),
    answer("theme(legend.position =  c(0.5,0.5))", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```


## End  


Congratulations! You finished the entire module on ggplot! This is a difficult topic, but you now have all the essential tools to go forth and make many kinds of plots.
