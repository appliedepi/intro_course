<details markdown=1><summary markdown="span" style='text-decoration: underline'>Click here for step-by-step instructions</summary>  
  
### 1. Download course files  

[**Click here**](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/appliedepi/intro_course/tree/main/intro_course) to download a zipped folder to use in the course exercises.  
     
**Unzip the folder and save it on your computer's desktop (not on a shared drive).** To "unzip" a folder once it is downloaded, right-click on the folder and select "Extract All". If offered a choice of location to save the unzipped folder, save it to your desktop.  

### 2. Create a new RStudio project  

1) Open RStudio. Ensure that you open *RStudio* and not just *R*.  

2) In RStudio click *File -> New Project*. In the pop-up window, select **"Existing directory"**.  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/README_images/create_project.png")
```

3) Click "browse" and select the "intro_course" folder on your desktop, that you downloaded earlier, which contains the course materials.  

4) Click "Create project"  

Voila! This will be the project for ALL of your work in this course.  
 
### 3. Download Applied Epi course exercises  


The rest of the course will utilize the R package {learnr} to provide interactive exercises *within* your RStudio window. To access these custom exercises, follow these instructions below. If you need help, notify your breakout facilitator.  

**Copy and paste this command into your R Console as shown below, then press the "Enter" key to run the command:**  

**`remotes::install_github("appliedepi/introexercises", dep = TRUE, force = TRUE)`**  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/README_images/install_exercises.png")
```

Text will begin to appear in the Console, below the command. Do not worry, R is simply downloading the tutorials from the internet and printing updates. *Watch the print-out for any questions that R may ask you:*  

  * If you see a printed warning about needing "RTools", do not worry. This is simply a warning message and the install should proceed without error.  
  * If prompted to update some R packages, select "All" to update all of the packages.  
  * If you continue to be prompted for package updates, you can select "None" and continue without further updates.  
 
 

### 4. Begin the first exercise

The course exercises will appear *within your RStudio*. Each course module has a corresponding exercise, which can be accessed through the "Tutorials" pane in RStudio (upper-left). The gif below introduces you to the exercise environment (you do not need to follow the steps shown right now).  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/README_images/exercise_demo_short_words.gif")
```

1) Click on the "Tutorial" tab in the upper-right RStudio pane (which also contains a tab holding your "Environment").  

2) Select the exercise "Applied Epi - R setup, syntax, data import"  

  * If you do not see any "Applied Epi" exercises, notify your instructor. They make some time to appear.  
  * The exercise will load. Once you see the Applied Epi logo appear in the Tutorials pane, you can begin the exercise.  
  * To see the sidebar in the exercise, you may need to adjust the Tutorials pane to be wider. You can also adjust the zoom from the "View" menu.  
  * You can view the exercise in this pane, or click the small icon in the upper-left to pop-out into a separate window.

# Modules  

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Module 1: Introduction to R  

We welcome you to the course and dive into the basics of how to interact with R and RStudio, basic R syntax, and how to organize your analytical projects. Finally, we cover R functions and packages, and introduce the core functions used to import data. Using these, we import the Ebola case study surveillance linelist, and begin to inspect and review it.  

- [Slides: Welcome, course logistics, RStudio, and basic R syntax](https://appliedepi.github.io/intro_course/modules/module_1/slides/course_introduction/slides_course_introduction.html)  

- Live demonstration ([instructor guide](https://appliedepi.github.io/intro_course/modules/module_1/guides/rstudio_tour.html))  

- Exercise:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/README_images/pointer_tutorial_setup.png")
```

## Module 2: Data cleaning  
Now that we have our surveillance linelist in R, we cover what "data cleaning" steps are necessary and how to execute these in R. Along the way, we introduce many of the core R functions including adjusting column names, deduplicating and filtering rows, selecting and modifying columns, recoding values, and more. Together, we write a sequence of "pipes" to clean the linelist step-by-step in a clear, reproducible manner... so that our dataset is ready for preliminary analysis!  

- [Slides: Tidy data and data cleaning](https://appliedepi.github.io/intro_course/modules/module_2/slides/slides_cleaning_dplyr/slides_cleaning_dplyr.html)  

- Exercise:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/README_images/pointer_tutorial_cleaning.png")
```

## Module 3: Grouping data and making summary tables  
Informative tables are the bedrock of epidemiological and public health practice. In this module we introduce three tools to produce tables of summary statistics: {dplyr} for flexibility, {janitor} for speed, and {gtsummary} for beauty. Finally, we explore {flextable}, which can be used to beautiful any of the above approaches, add selecting colors and highlights, and save tables to Word, PNG, HTML, etc.  

- [Slides: Grouping and summarizing data](https://appliedepi.github.io/intro_course/modules/module_3/slides/slides_summary_tables/slides_grouping_summaries.html)  

- Exercise:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/README_images/pointer_tutorial_grouping.png")
```

## Module 4: Data visualization with {ggplot2}  
Using the {ggplot2} package to maximum effect rests upon understanding how to apply its "grammar of graphics" to build a plot layer-by-layer. We tackle this piece-by-piece, introducing concepts one-by-one so that you build upon previous knowledge to construct informative and colorful bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, line plots, text labels that automatically update with refreshed data (very useful for epidemiological reports!), and more.  

- [Slides: Data visualization with ggplot2](https://appliedepi.github.io/intro_course/modules/module_4/slides/slides_ggplot_basics/slides_ggplot_basics.html)  

- Exercise:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/README_images/pointer_tutorial_ggplot_basics.png")
```

- [Slides: Scales, themes, and labels](https://appliedepi.github.io/intro_course/modules/module_4/slides/slides_ggplot_scales_labels/slides_ggplot_scales_labels.html)  

- Exercise:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/README_images/pointer_tutorial_ggplot_scales.png")
```


## Module 5: Transforming data   

Public health analytics rarely involves just one data set, so now we practice joining data by adding hospital, laboratory, and case investigation data to our surveillance linelist. We engrain best practices for conducting joins, and prepare your for doing data transformations independently. In the second part of this module, we address *pivoting*, which in R means transforming data between "long" and "wide" formats. This is particularly relevant in public health, where each format has distinct benefits.  
- [Slides: Joining data](https://appliedepi.github.io/intro_course/modules/module_5/slides/slides_joins/slides_joins.html)  

- Exercise:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/README_images/pointer_tutorial_joining.png")
```

- [Slides: Pivoting data](https://appliedepi.github.io/intro_course/modules/module_5/slides/slides_pivots/slides_pivots.html)  

- Exercise:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/README_images/pointer_tutorial_pivoting.png")
```


## Module 6: More data visualization with {ggplot2}  
In this second data visualization module we encourage you to practice learning R independently (a necessary skill once you leave the class!) but with our support. We jump in to tackle visualizations that are central to descriptive epidemiology: the intricacies of crafting an accurate epidemic curve, conveying three continuous variables with a heat plot, and creating age/sex pyramids to convey demographics.  

- [Slides: Epidemic curves in ggplot2]()  TODO  
- [Slides: Heat plots in ggplot2]()  TODO  
- [Slides: Age/sex pyramids in ggplot2]()  TODO  
- [Slides: GIS demonstration](https://appliedepi.github.io/intro_course/modules/module_6/slides/slides_gis_demo/slides_gis_demo.html)  

## Module 7: Routine reports with R Markdown  
In this module, we take the R code on the Ebola case study that you have been building throughout the course and convert it into a reproducible, automated report (Word, PDF, HTML, etc.). We teach you the variations in syntax and opportunties that lie in being able to produce documents that update when incoming data is refreshed, that look professional, and can be sent to inform public health parters and stakeholders.

- [Slides: R markdown and routine reports](https://appliedepi.github.io/intro_course/modules/module_7/slides/slides_rmd/slides_rmd.html)  

- Exercise:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/README_images/pointer_tutorial_rmarkdown.png")
```


## Module 8: Final exercise and code review  
In this last module, your skills are tested as you have to produce an R Markdown report using a COVID-19 case linelist. Unlike with the Ebola case study, you will not have the answer code available to you. When you finish, we perform "code reviews", simultaneously improving your coding skills and teaching you how to review others' code. Before closing, we touch upon how to find your particular community of R users, resources available to you for questions, and close with a feedback survey.

- [Slides: Code review]()  TODO  

## Sustained support  
Our instructors *know* public health. One of the signature features of Applied Epi's training is that we provide follow-up support to your team, to help you apply your new skills to your work context. We schedule 1.5-hour sessions with your team at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months post-training. In these sessions, we help you troubleshoot code, advise you on analytical strategies, or guide you in new learning that you need.  


## Notes  
- Please note that all of our case study training materials use *fake example data* in which no person is identifiable and the actual values have been scrambled.  
- Modifications are possible so that the course uses data from *your* jurisdiction. Email us at contact@appliedepi.org us to discuss.
