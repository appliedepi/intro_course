# Introduction to R for Applied Epidemiology  


<img src = "https://github.com/appliedepi/epiRhandbook_eng/raw/master/images/Applied_Epi_logo.png" height = "200" align = "right">


[This website](https://appliedepi.github.io/intro_course) hosts training materials for "Introduction to R for Applied Epidemiologists". This course teaches the fundamentals of R for applied epidemiologists and public health practitioners.  

[**Applied Epi**](www.appliedepi.org) is a nonprofit organization supporting frontline practitioners through open-course analytical tools, training, and support. Our [Epidemiologist R Handbook](www.epirhandbook.com) is a free R reference manual which has been used by 130,000 people around the world.

# Course exercises  

THESE ARE DRAFTS  

The course utilizes the R package {learnr} to provide interactive exercises *within* your RStudio window. To access these custom exercises, follow these instructions:

1) Set up R and RStudio (we will provide instructions and troubleshooting before the course)  

2) Run these commands in your R console:  
`install.packges("learnr")`  
`install.packages("remotes")`  

3) Run this command in your R console:  
`remotes::install_github("appliedepi/introexercises", dep = TRUE, force = TRUE)`  
Follow any prompted instructions regarding necessary updates  

4) To open an exercise, Click on the "Tutorial" tab in the upper-right RStudio pane (which also contains a tab holding your R Environment).  
  * the first time, you may need to restart your R session for the tutorials to appear.  
  
5) Select the exercise for your current course module - look for the name "Applied Epi -".  
  * You can proceed with the exercise in this pane, or click the small icon to expand this tutorial into a separate window.  
  * Watch the gif below. The exercise will provide sample code that you can run from your R script.  
  * Return to the exercise to answer quiz questions and proceed to the next section of the exercise.
