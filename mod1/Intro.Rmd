What are some of your concerns or worries about learning R?

What hopes do you have about learning R?


---
# Today's session   

Today is primarily *explanation* and *demonstration*. 

We are going to assume basic understanding of *R* syntax. 

We also assume you have reviewed the Handbook pages on [R Basics](https://epirhandbook.com/r-basics.html), [Cleaning data and core functions](https://epirhandbook.com/cleaning-data-and-core-functions.html), and [Reports with R markdown](https://epirhandbook.com/reports-with-r-markdown.html) 

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/presentation/images/EDGE.png?raw=true)  



???
- The learning process can be summarised into this acronym "EDGE". Today's session is primarily a *demonstration* with question & answer session. We assume that you have read at least some of the relevant pages in the Epi R Handbook prior to this session. We also offer trainings in which we guide you through case studies with hands-on coaching.

# Outline
  
1. Why R? 
2. Setting the scene (project directory & Rmarkdown)  
3. Rmarkdown parametrisation  
4. File paths & importing data  
5. Data cleaning  
6. Merging data  
7. Descriptive analysis  
8. If time allows:  
  a. Statistical analysis  
  b. Logistic regression  
    
Prioritised report generation -> simpler code in the Handbook

# Why R? 
### An appetizer for motivation

# Flexibility 

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/presentation/images/interoperability.png?raw=true)  


???
- R can read and write to loads of different software/databases.  
- Can also produce many different outputs  
- Save you time and headache (automated and reproducible workflows)

# Popularity

```

???
- R is free - and yet can do more than what expensive licensed software can  
- Most students in the US will have learnt SAS (but changing)  
- Previously limited to academic statisticians - R was not "trusted"  
- But now even pharma companies (e.g. GSK) and regulators are making the switch  
- It is the most widely used statistical programming language.

# Setting the scene 
### Using [Rmarkdown](https://epirhandbook.com/reports-with-r-markdown.html?q=rmark#reports-with-r-markdown) for reports

# Setting the scene  
#### Download our [example R project](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/tree/master/case_study)! (be sure to un-zip)


We created a dedicated R project, a directory containing:  

R project file (`case_study.Rproj`)  
  * `data/` folder  
    * `covid_example_data/` folder 
        * `covid_example_data.xlsx`  
        * `linelist_cleaned.rds`  
        * `covid_shapefile/` folder  
          - `FultonCountryZipCode.shp`...
    * `map_tiles/` folder 
        * base map images for Fulton County...
  * `weekly_report.Rmd` (R markdown script)  
    * `template_style.docx`
    * `weekly_report.docx`
    * `weekly_report.md`
    * `weekly_report_files/` folder

# Rmarkdown parameterisation  

- Rmd files use YAML header

- Use parameters to generalise reports for different scenarios
 + different dates
 + different counties
 
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
params:
  as_of_date: 2021-08-01
  county: "Fulton"
```

- Access parameters with `params$...`

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# filter linelist for county of choice
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  filter(county == params$county)
```

# File paths

#### Use the `{here}` package to find files

.pull-left[
- *Relative* rather than *absolute* file-paths 
  - Better than `setwd()` for sharing
- Finds root directory automatically 
- Open `.Rproj` file first
- package::function() to avoid conflicts
  - `here::here()`
